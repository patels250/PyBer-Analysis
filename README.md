# PyBer-Analysis

## Project Overview

We have been tasked with using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to perform analysis and visualization for a ridesharing company, PyBer. The ridesharing data needs to be split by city type (urban, suburban, or rural). We need to determine the total rides, total drivers, total fares, and average fares by ride/driver and create a new DataFrame for these summary statistics. We also need to plot the total weekly fares for each city type on a line graph.
