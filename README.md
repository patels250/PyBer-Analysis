## Summary

This is a versatile script that can be used to calculate the results of any election where data is stored in a CSV file. To make this script run analysis for any election, a few simple modifications need to be made. The correct file name and path needs to be coded into Line 9 of the script. The script can also be expanded to show the county with the lowest voter turnout. This could be useful if running analysis on elections with dozens of counties involved.
